# AutoPV BOT


## Problem 
we, as an inspired future engineers, thought of making writing PVs more flexible and fast through developing a discord bot named “AutoPV”.

## how to set the bot ?

* First you have to colone this repo 
 ```git
 git clone https://github.com/GDGAlgiers/discord.js-bot-template
  ```
* then you have to put the token of your bot , and the guild id and the client id of your discord server , int the config.js file 


 ```
 {
	"clientId": "your client id ",
	"guildId": "your guild id",
	"token": "your bot's tokent"
}
  ```
* install the dependencies
```npm
npm install 
  ```
* run the bot.js file 
```node
node src/bot.js 
  ```
